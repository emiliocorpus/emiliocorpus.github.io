    <font size="3px">Hello friend! My name is Emilio and you are currently viewing my blog. I am fairly new to the world of web development, but am quite excited to expand my ever-growing knowledge of the subject. I graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in biology, and up until recently, have had the intention to work somewhere in healthcare. However, after working several years in the emergency department, I have decided that being a healthcare provider is not my dream anymore. I turned to coding after our ED switched from a bland electronic medical record into something much more customizable, called EPIC&copy;<br>
    Since then I have tried many tutorials, and am currently enrolled in Devbootcamp's programs in San Francisco, CA. I am quite excited about the journery I have embarked upon. I cannot wait to see what I can do with my ever-growing knowledge, and I look forward to building amazing programs for the world to use!<br>
    Besides my new found love for coding, I am an avid ukulele player and love to play as much basketball as I can.
