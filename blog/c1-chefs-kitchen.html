        I am quite excited about what DBC will bring to me, not only as a coder, but as a person. Learning any new subject is no way easy. However, if you approach the problem with a pinch of confidence, and a passion, I believe you will in turn become a successful coder.
      </p>

          After watching Shareef’s Fireside Chat, I was afraid that I had both mindsets he described, that is the kitchen mindset vs restaurant mindset. The restaurant mindset, as explained by Shareef, is that in which you walk into a restaurant (bootcamp), with the expectations that you are going to receive everything that you pay for. I am not going to lie, there is an aspect of me that had this mindset after applying and paying the tuition. But there is a bigger part of me that is more excited about what the switch into coding will provide for me. This is the kitchen mindset, in which everyone is a cook, each with their own experience and expertise, their own passions and ideas, their own desires and goals.
      </p>

          My expectations of DBC has not really changed. Although there was a part of me who turned to this program as a way to help me get a new career, I knew going in that you only get out whatever hard work you put in. Of course I’m quite nervous for this program, as I am pretty much a ‘newbie’. I have definitely felt quite miniscule after reading some of the other cohorts experience. But I understand that I am not the only one in this boat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall I am quite excited to see what the program will provide and teach me. Despite all of our different experiences and resumes, I understand that we are all in this together, and we are all ultimately working to become great software engineers
