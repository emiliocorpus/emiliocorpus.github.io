      So after perusing my different news feeds and subreddits, I came across this interesting <a href="http://sakurity.com/blog/2015/05/21/starbucks.html">blog post</a>. It is a very curious read, and I highly recommend looking through it yourself. But to sum it up, a security consultant named Egor Homakov for a website called Sakurity found a vulnerability with Starbuck's card balance transfers. He mentioned a term "race condition", which he states is a common bug for websites with balances or vouchers. This "race condition" becomes a bug when certain events do not happen in the order the programmer intended. In the article he talks about his pseudocode and his thought processess. After a while of failed experimenting, he was able to eventually create 2 cards; his first card was the original card with $5, and the 2nd card was a newly generated card with a $15 value.<br><br>
      He went to a local Starbucks, tried out the cards, and was able to successfully use both cards. He contacted (or at least tried) Starbucks tech support, but states they never really got back to him about the bug he had found. Eventually a Starbucks official, apparently from Starbucks infosec team, responded to his query and instead of praising him and thanking him, told him that he had committed fraud.<br><br>
      Homakov states in his blog that he could have easily made millions off of this bug by creating different Starbucks credits online and selling them. But no, he decided to be a responsible human being, and instead of being praised by the company he tried to help, he got insulted.<br><br>
      Anyways, I thought it would be nice to share this post. As a new programmer who is still trying to find his way, this debugging news was quite intriguing. Until next time!
