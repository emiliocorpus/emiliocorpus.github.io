        As a developing programmer, its fair to say that I have been swimming (at times drowning) in some shark-infested uncharted waters. There are times where I am alone and have no idea what direction to take. If it weren't for peer programming, I surely would be second guessing my new career choice. <br><br>Through these sessions I have seen that most of us are quite similar (no CS experience), while others have a better foothold. Being someone in the former situation, I can say that it's honestly a huge relief knowing that I am not the only one daunted by certain challenges. It can, at times, be quite intimidating working with others who know what the heck they are doing. There have definitely been times where I feel incompetent, but on the other hand, there are plenty of more times where I understand what I am doing and actually enjoy the work. I am not sure about everyone else in DBC, but speaking for myself, I find great satisfaction when I run an <code>rspec</code> on a certain challenge and get the<br><br> <font color="#33CC33">N examples, 0 failures</font><br><br> returned to me. Working with pairs has truly helped me see that <font color="33CC33">green</font> more often than not.<br><br>
        Up to this day, I have not had any trouble with my pairing sessions. Of the people I have worked with so far, everyone is friendly and patient. I am the type of learner who likes to truly understand what is going on by going through each line several times. With pair programming, it can be hard to judge if the person is okay with your methods of learning, but from my experience just let them know in the beginning what works best for you! I know for some, it can truly be frustrating being patient and learning in a way you are not comfortable with. I think it is best to realize that everyone's brain works differently. The best way for everyone to learn is to be honest while still respecting a person's methods.<br><br>
        To be honest, I was initially afraid of the feedback that is mandatory for DBC. I think this was because I didn't want to recieve feedback like<br><br> <em>"Emilio does not know what the *$%^ he is doing, why is this fool even trying to become a dev? His learning styles are horrible, how did he even graduate college?!"</em> etc.. <br><br>
        Now that I think about it, I truly embrace feedback with no fear of what people may write. The feedback recieved is there to make you learn and pair better. When I approach my peering sessions, I now try to incorporate the advice recieved from my past sessions. I can honestly say that it has helped me become more efficient in terms of peer programming. Now, in terms of writing Feedback, I like to use the old adage "Treat someone the way you want to be treated". In terms of me as a person, I love it when people are honest, yet respectful, and that's how I would write my feedback. There is still room for improvement in writing feedback, as at times I need to be more honest about that person's work. But since I haven't really had a session in which the pair was "horrible", my feedback has been short, concise, and to the point. I still need to be more specific in my criticisms.<br><br>
        Peer programming is definitely a great learning method and I have enjoyed every bit of it. It helps me get an idea of where I need to be and what I need to work on. Collaboration is really key to my learning style, and thus peer programming has been a great help in understanding the code. Receiving and writing Feedback has been an experience that truly benefits me by making me become a kind, critical, yet respectful programmer. I welcome the future Feedback with open arms, and am glad to hear what I need to work on. This journey is only at it's beginning, and I can't wait to see where it brings me! Cheers DBC!
