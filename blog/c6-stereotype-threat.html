        Growing up as a young Filpino male in the good ol' white surburb of Alamo, CA, I was at times exposed to some pretty awkward stereotypes. Don't get me wrong, I was quite blessed to have been raised in such an affluent area  and by no means was my childhood defined by these stereotypical moments. Nonetheless, they still did happen, and I would be lying to you if I said they had no affect on me, after all I still remember them today.<br><br>
        From my understanding, a <em>stereotype threat</em> can lead to many things, such as underachievement on academic tasks, self-handicapping strategies, and reduced sense of belonging to the stereotyped domain. I can see why this would be a relevant topic for students at DBC. Most of us are quite new to the world of programming (myself included), and it honestly can make us quite anxious when we all see these brilliant people/solutions/peers. We start asking ourselves, do I really got what it takes? "His/her solution was so incredible, I can't do that, what am I doing?" Do I fit the mold of a programmer?<br><br>
        It honestly is up to you and you alone in terms of whether you think becoming a web developer is for you. Phase 0 is basically a trial run after all. There is no wrong in checking your pride at the door and being honest with how you feel. But there is wrong with letting stereotypes determine your goals and your dreams.<br><br>
        The racial and stereotypical moments were pretty damn obvious where I grew up. For some reason, probably due to my complexion, throughout my childhood many kids (even adults) thought me to be of some Hispanic background. They would call me "beaner" or "beanie boy", etc. There was even a time where I was helping my father trim hedges outside my own house and some neighbor had the audacity to come up to us and ask "How much do you guys charge?"  <br><br>
        I still got the Asian stereotypes as well; at times being called "chink" or "fob". On the opposite end I also didn't feel pressured to fit the mold of the "all A Asian student", nor did I lash out against people when they told me I would never amount to anything because of my race. Instead it fueled my drive to do well in school and in sports. I let my actions do the talking, which is what everyone of us should do. We should let our code and our drive do the talking. These racial/stereotypical moments drove me to be as well-rounded as I could, as I wanted to prove to myself (not them) that I could hang with anybody as long as I put my mind to it.
        <br><br>
        The stereotypes we may have about the web development world honestly varies from person to person. If you are like me and have fought stereotypes during some part of your life, then transitioning into this new population of the working class will probably be gravy. But the fears created by stereotypes still remain for some. All I can say is be yourself, and don't let the status/success of other people deter you from your aspirations. We are in the beginning stages of our web dev careers, and it is natural to feel scared and insignificant. Just remember that those individuals you may be afraid of started out not knowing a damn thing about programming like me and you. Stereotypes will always be a part of our lives in some way or the other. It is what you do during these situations that define who you will be as a person. Again, there is nothing wrong with following your heart, but there is always wrong in following anothers. We all got what it takes to learn and become great programmers.
