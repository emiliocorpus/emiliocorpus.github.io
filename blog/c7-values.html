      Upon thinking of when I have been the most happiest, proudest, or most satisfied in my life the following words include but are not limited to:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Excited</li>
        <li>Inspired</li>
        <li>Tranquility</li>
        <li>Persistence</li>
        <li>Focues</li>
        <li>Serenity</li>
        <li><u>Commitment</u></li>
        <li>Confidence</li>
        <li>Integrity</li>
      </ul><br>
    On a scale from 1 to 5 in regards of how I try to live up to these values, 1 being disagree and 5 being agree, I would rank it a 5, all the way. I have learned over these last several years that having certain values and virtues to live for are quite important to sustaining a healthy lifestyle. I specifically find myself the proudest whenever I know I have given a certain task my all.<br><br>

     I am a huge Oakland Raider fan, and one of the mottos the late, great Al Davis embedded into his ball club was the infamous "<em>Commitment</em> to Excellence". This quote really holds dear to me. My family has taught me to always give my 210% to a task and no matter the outcome be proud of the fact that you put your heart and soul into it. Of course there were times where I was frustrated with a certain outcome. But at the end of the day knowing I did everything I could gave me closure and confidence that I was heading in the right direction. I still to this day look at this quote (in my bathroom) and remind myself that I should always give my best effort. I truly am happiest knowing that I gave a task my all, because otherwise I would just keep asking myself "what if?", and I can tell you now that having regrets about anything can tear you apart.<br><br>

     I have a friend that is currently going through graduate school all the way in the east coast. He has called me and told me he is quite lonely and at times very depressed. My advice to him was to "keep on trucking". I told him to stay persistent with his goal and use tunnel vision until he is done. Although my virtues don't directly relate to depression and loneliness, I believe focusing on tasks is important to forgetting the sadness/stresses one may have. In way, you have to be commited to your work. It may not make you the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied in your life, but will definitely help keep you on the right track away from the darkness.<br><br>

     My values can definitely help mediate any stereotype threat that may be directed towards me. Like I had told my friend, staying commited to a goal will help in a way distract you from the sadness/stresses. Because at the end of the day, knowing you put the best "you" will help elimnate those regrets you may have had you not put your best effort into a goal. I understand that we are all human, and even if you do put your best effort forward, some may feel saddened and discouraged. I advise those types of people to find some type of method to help distract you and keep you from getting even more depressed. For me, I love playing basketball or playing video games and find that these 2 hobbies of mine are a great escape from the stresses that may be slowly tearing me apart. Another thing to do is talk it out with family or friends. The worst you can do is hold it in and not discusss your problems with anybody. If any of you in my cohort are every in such a depressing mood, please do not hesitate to talk to me. I am a great listener, and I believe myself to be a great advisor as well.
