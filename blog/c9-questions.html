      As someone who is relatively new to programming I have at times (actually, more often that not) needed help and guidance with my learning.  When I cannot get help from classmates and friends, I usually resort to a good ol' <em>google</em> search. I am usually pointed towards a similar topic on <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/' name='stack overflow'>Stack Overflow:</a>
      <blockquote cite='http://stackoverflow.com/'><em>"... a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers."</em> </blockquote>

      <p>During my last 9 weeks of highs and lows, I have turned to peers, friends and the interweb for help and guidance. In my belief there is no such thing as a "perfect" question, only near-perfect as anything can be improved. However, you must understand that there are very important elements when asking such a question.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Context</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This includes the language/framework in question, the problem/error, original poster's (OP) code, the goal the OP is trying to achieve</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Thoughts behind error</li>
        <ul>
          <li>An OP should not post a question to just receieve an answer. He/she should post a question to help understand/solidify the concept in question </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Therefore, it should be in good practice to prompt a reasoning behind the original code</li>
            <li>If you can, it may be good to supply a direction in which you think the error/problem can be fixed</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Feedback</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Regardless of if you are using a question/answer website or not, a person should always stay involved with the discussion</li>
              <ul>
                <li>There are many times where you take the first solution you see, but understanding that there can be multiple ways to solve your problem will help you avoid further similar problems down the road</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>More Questions</li>
          <ul>
            <li>When still confused and in doubt, ask away!</li>
            <li>It is never wrong to keep on asking</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>
      <p>When using  resource websites like <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/' name='stack overflow'>Stack Overflow</a>, I think it is important to not select a solution just because it is a solution. Be patient and try to understand why that person decided to use those methods/functions/classes/etc. When one has deadlines or has been working on a solution for most of the day, it can be easy to just select the first thing that pops up. I have done this a couple times during my early weeks of DBC, and learned fast that is the worst thing you can do.</p>


      <p>These are just a few of the elements that I believe is important for the near "perfect" question. It is by no means limited to these several elements, but in my opinion are quite important to the way I try to get help. TAKE YOUR TIME. LEARN WHAT YOU ARE READING. AND IF YOU ARE STILL CONFUSED, ASK ANOTHER 'PERFECT' QUESTION!
