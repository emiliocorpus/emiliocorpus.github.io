    <font size="1px">Hello friend! My name is Emilio and you are currently viewing my blog. I am fairly new to the world of web development, but am quite excited to expand my ever-growing knowledge of the subject. I graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in biology, and up until recently, have had to intention to work somewhere in healthcare. However, after working several years in emergency department, I have decided that being a healthcare provider is not my dream anymore. I turned to coding after our ED switched from a bland electronic medical record into something much more customizable, called EPIC&copy;<br>
    Since then I have tried many tutorials, and am currently enrolled in Devbootcamp's programs in San Francisco, CA! Go Grasshoppers!<br>

      Greetings world! My name, is Emilio, a prospective programmer who will take any advice and help I can get to reach my goal. Over the last few years I have been working as a medical scribe, but have learned that I am not as passionate as I once was. I have always been intrigued by the world of computers, specifically programming. I applied to DevBootcamp after deciding I wanted to make the switch and I am so grateful to have been given this chance to learn.

        What are the benefits of version control?
        Version control is a type of system in which one can easily track their past changes. This is important when you are working on the same files with other developers. Version Control helps manage workflow so no one steps on anyone’s else’s toes, and if something does go wrong you can always just go back to anearlier version. The two popular version control systems are Subversion and Git.

    </p>
    <p class="blog-text">
        What is Git?
        It is an open-source version control system (free) that allows developers to track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project. It is designed such that it views your code files like a “tree”.

    </p>

    <p class="blog-text">
        Why use GitHub?
        GitHub is like a cloud-based service for programmers. It is an open source for sharing and distributing(if you please) code amongst other developers. This makes it quite useful in terms of allowing someone in your project to edit the code without disrupting the master code.

        I am quite excited about what DBC will bring to me, not only as a coder, but as a person. Learning any new subject is no way easy. However, if you approach the problem with a pinch of confidence, and a passion, I believe you will in turn become a successful coder.

          After watching Shareef’s Fireside Chat, I was afraid that I had both mindsets he described, that is the kitchen mindset vs restaurant mindset. The restaurant mindset, as explained by Shareef, is that in which you walk into a restaurant (bootcamp), with the expectations that you are going to receive everything that you pay for. I am not going to lie, there is an aspect of me that had this mindset after applying and paying the tuition. But there is a bigger part of me that is more excited about what the switch into coding will provide for me. This is the kitchen mindset, in which everyone is a cook, each with their own experience and expertise, their own passions and ideas, their own desires and goals.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
          My expectations of DBC has not really changed. Although there was a part of me who turned to this program as a way to help me get a new career, I knew going in that you only get out whatever hard work you put in. Of course I’m quite nervous for this program, as I am pretty much a ‘newbie’. I have definitely felt quite miniscule after reading some of the other cohorts experience. But I understand that I am not the only one in this boat.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-text">
        Overall I am quite excited to see what the program will provide and teach me. Despite all of our different experiences and resumes, I understand that we are all in this together, and we are all ultimately working to become great software engineers
