      Greetings world! My name, is Emilio, a prospective programmer who will take any advice and help I can get to reach my goal. Over the last few years I have been working as a medical scribe, but have learned that I am not as passionate as I once was. I have always been intrigued by the world of computers, specifically programming. I applied to DevBootcamp after deciding I wanted to make the switch and I am so grateful to have been given this chance to learn.

        What are the benefits of version control?
        Version control is a type of system in which one can easily track their past changes. This is important when you are working on the same files with other developers. Version Control helps manage workflow so no one steps on anyone’s else’s toes, and if something does go wrong you can always just go back to anearlier version. The two popular version control systems are Subversion and Git.

        What is Git?
        It is an open-source version control system (free) that allows developers to track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project. It is designed such that it views your code files like a “tree”.

        Why use GitHub?
        GitHub is like a cloud-based service for programmers. It is an open source for sharing and distributing(if you please) code amongst other developers. This makes it quite useful in terms of allowing someone in your project to edit the code without disrupting the master code.
