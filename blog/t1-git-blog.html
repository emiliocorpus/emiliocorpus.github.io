      Greetings world! My name, is Emilio, a prospective programmer who will take any <br>advice and help I can get to reach my goal. Over the last few years I have <br>been working as a medical scribe, but have learned that I am not as <br>passionate as I once was. I have always been intrigued by the world of <br>computers, specifically programming. I applied to DevBootcamp after deciding I <br>wanted to make the switch and I am so grateful to have been given this <br>chance to learn.<br>

        What are the benefits of version control?<br>
        Version control is a type of system in which one can easily track their past <br>changes. This is important when you are working on the same files with other<br> developers. Version Control helps manage workflow so no one steps on anyone’s <br>else’s toes, and if something does go wrong you can always just go back to an<br> earlier version. The two popular version control systems are Subversion and <br>Git. <br>

    <p>
        What is Git?<br>
        It is an open-source version control system (free) that allows developers to <br> track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project. <br>It is designed such that it views your code files like a “tree”. <br>

        Why use GitHub?<br>
        GitHub is like a cloud-based service for programmers. It is an open source <br>for sharing and distributing(if you please) code amongst other developers. <br>This makes it quite useful in terms of allowing someone in your project to <br>edit the code without disrupting the master code. <br>
